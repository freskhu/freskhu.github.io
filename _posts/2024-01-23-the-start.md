## What is this space
This space will be used to store my documentation used for my HomeLab services and developement. I will dedicate a space to share some crypto stuff, trading bots and general trading stuff.

## Why
My main objective with this space is to store my documentation in an organized manner and to easily share with family and friends

## Who am i
I am a middle aged engineer (in the 40's) that has huge passion for TI, gaming, trading and crypto, having several experiences: running crypto mining facilities, working on a cryptocurrency startup, becoming a funded trader on Topstep and Apex, running crypto bots for several years, trading own capital, etc. On the gaming field i played lineage 2 in retail, CS 1.6 for real and other games just for fun.
