## What is this space
This space will store the documentation used for my HomeLab services and development. I will dedicate a space to share crypto, trading bots, and general trading stuff..

## Why
My main objective with this space is to store my documentation in an organized manner and to share with family and friends easily

## Who am I
I am a middle-aged engineer (in my 40s) who has a huge passion for TI, gaming, trading, and crypto, having several experiences: running crypto mining facilities, working on a cryptocurrency startup, becoming a funded trader on Topstep and Apex, running crypto bots for several years, trading own capital, etc. On the gaming field, I played Lineage 2 in retail, CS 1.6 for real, and other games just for fun.
